| My name is Thomas Stieglmaier. I’m a 24 year old guy from bavaria, studying “M.Sc. Computer Science” at the `University of Passau`_. Besides studying at the university, I'm working as a student assistant at the `Software Systems Lab`_, for over three years by now. But there's even more: the last three years I was a co-teacher in the summer-camp for projects concerning Hadoop, Povray and Android Programming. More details can be found at my `cv`_.
|
| |ieeepic| Currently I'm also the vice-chairman of the `IEEE Student Branch Passau`_. Which is the only technical oriented student group at our university. Our aim is to provide regular talks/workshops to technically related topics of all kinds. These events are a great opportunity to get in touch with other students, lecturers and companies, something the university can't offer.

| |shootingpic| As you can imagine my interests are mostly related to technology and/or engineering, but besides that, I’m shooting air rifle in my hometown Dingolfing at the shooting club `Edelweiß Dingolfing`_.
